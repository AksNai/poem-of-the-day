  "poem": "At the stables, each stall was labeled with a name.\nBiscuit stood aloof — I faced, always, invariably, his clockwork tail.\nCrab knew the salt lick too well.\nTrapezoid mastered stillness: a midnight mare, she was sternest and tallest, her chest stretched against the edges of her stall.\nI was not afraid of Never, the chestnut gelding, so rode his iron haunches as far as Panther Gap.\nNever and I lived in Virginia then.\nWe could neither flee nor be kept.\nSeldom did I reach the little mountain without him, the easy crests making valleys of indifferent grasses.\nWhat was that low sound I heard, alone with Never?\nA lone horse, a lodestar, a habit of fear.\n_We think of a horse less as the history of one man and his sorrows than as the history of a whole evil time._\nWhy I chose Never I’ll never know.\nI fed him odd lettuce, abundant bitterness.\nWho wore the bit and harness, who was the ready steed.\nNever took the carrot, words by my own reckoning, an account of creeks and oystercatchers.\nOur hoof-house rested at the foot of the mountain, on which rested another house more brazen than statuary.\nLet it be known: I first mistook gelding for gilding.\nI am the fool that has faith in Never.\nSomewhere, a gold door burdened with apology refuses all mint from the yard."
