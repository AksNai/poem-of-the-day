  "poem": "We were dancing—it must have\n been a foxtrot or a waltz,\n something romantic but\n requiring restraint,\n rise and fall, precise\n execution as we moved\n into the next song without\n stopping, two chests heaving\n above a seven-league\n stride—such perfect agony,\n one learns to smile through,\n ecstatic mimicry\n being the _sine qua non_\n of American Smooth.\n And because I was distracted\n by the effort of\n keeping my frame\n (the leftward lean, head turned\n just enough to gaze out\n past your ear and always\n smiling, smiling),\n I didn’t notice\n how still you’d become until\n we had done it\n (for two measures?\n four?)—achieved flight,\n that swift and serene\n magnificence,\n before the earth\n remembered who we were\n and brought us down."
