  "poem": "Just tell me who the hell am I?\n What powers did I, do I hold?\n What right have I to say “my”\n or “mine” or “me” — all honey-\n glazed, all bullet-proofed and\n worshipful of any gangster “I”?\n The key to the Dollar Store\n hangs on my belt. Yes, “my”\n again. And what of roof, of bread,\n of loving laughter? What’s in?\n My vinyl favorite Booker Little,\n vintage, soothes me. He jars\n our ears with trumpet joy and\n stuff freed folks stash in cabinets.\n Never one to make too much of\n why we love and what, I love my\n powers. I might put you in my will."
