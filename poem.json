  "poem": "_Because to speak, to speak like one's mother, means to dwell, even there where there are no tents._\n— Paul Celan (translated here by the author)\nIt wasn’t even around Pentecost\n and nothing was flowering\n but it was an overheated day\n mid-February & mid-town\n when twixt Anselm Kiefer at the Breuer-Met\n& Wagner’s Parsifal at the Met-Opera\n I sat down in the middle of Central Park\n on a bench exactly twixt those two Euro-Kulchural affairs\n to write this poem.\n(Don’t buy that hotdog, nor any of those\n nuts, too much sugar in both, but)\n look\n at that white horse, that nag\n makes no mistakes.\n it eats its oats\n and works through this heat,\n head bowed, gemütlich\n it shows New York\n to the tourists much better\n than I could.\nAnd the horse is neither sad-sack nor amused, like any\n thing or person pulling some form of transport\n conundrum through New York,\n it or he or she’s smilingly sullen\n or sullenly smiling & about ready to nap.\nI nod to the nag which doesn’t\n nod back, busy as it is to rhythmically\n nod its head following its heavy trot.\nAnd I keep nodding, body/mind\n caught in rhythm of horse’s\n nod, the clop-clop of its hoofs\n and, a hundred meters to the right,\n the quick nervous bang-bang of jazz drums\nit’s all one\n gorgeous\n rhythmic mess,\n it is the beat-\n ing heart of New York, & thus the true\n heartbeat of\n America—\n even if I am—\n no, not caught, but—strolling, or\n sitting in the sun\n between two Euro-references,\n but in the middle of the heat of this city\n I fell\n in love with exactly fifty years\n& seven months ago\n even if not always faithful—\n —& now I need\n a table & a cup-a-coffee—a question: the waitress’\n head raises—“straight up”\n I say—\n then sit down\n right in the window of the\n_European Café_\n (a name & a place\n does not translate into\n_Café Europe_ my old hangout on the Plëss)\n there where\n Columbus & Broadway\n intersect &\n now bring\n this poem to\n a close."
