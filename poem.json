  "poem": "The laws of science teach us a pound of gold weighs as\n\nmuch as a pound of flour though if dropped from any\n\nundetermined height in their natural state one would\n\nreach bottom and one would fly away\n\n\n\nLaws of motion tell us an inert object is more difficult to\n\npropel than an object heading in the wrong direction is to\n\nturn around. Motion being energy—inertia—apathy.\n\nApathy equals hostility. Hostility—violence. Violence\n\nbeing energy is its own virtue. Laws of motion teach us\n\n\n\nBlack people are no less confused because of our\n\nBlackness than we are diffused because of our\n\npowerlessness. Man we are told is the only animal who\n\nsmiles with his lips. The eyes however are the mirror of\n\nthe soul\n\n\n\nThe problem with love is not what we feel but what we\n\nwish we felt when we began to feel we should feel\n\nsomething. Just as publicity is not production: seduction\n\nis not seductive\n\n\n\nIf I could make a wish I’d wish for all the knowledge of all\n\nthe world. Black may be beautiful Professor Micheau\n\nsays but knowledge is power. Any desirable object is\n\nbought and sold—any neglected object declines in value.\n\nIt is against man’s nature to be in either category\n\n\n\nIf white defines Black and good defines evil then men\n\ndefine women or women scientifically speaking describe\n\nmen. If sweet is the opposite of sour and heat the\n\nabsence of cold then love is the contradiction of pain and\n\nbeauty is in the eye of the beheld\n\n\n\nSometimes I want to touch you and be touched in\n\nreturn. But you think I’m grabbing and I think you’re\n\nshirking and Mama always said to look out for men like\n\nyou\n\n\n\nSo I go to the streets with my lips painted red and my\n\neyes carefully shielded to seduce the world my reluctant\n\nlover\n\n\n\nAnd you go to your men slapping fives feeling good\n\nposing as a man because you know as long as you sit\n\nvery very still the laws of motion will be in effect",
