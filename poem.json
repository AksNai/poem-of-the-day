  "poem": "For Reg & Susie\nAs you are walking\n down the street\n this guy asks you\n to hold his violin.\n It’s a Stradivarius.\n Soon as it falls\n into your hands\n you start playing like crazy.\n The violin\n almost plays itself.\n Your powerful hands\n nearly break the instrument\n but the music is gentle and sweet.\n You sweep your long artistic hair\n out of your face.\n Everybody\n in the room,\n in the bull ring, in the\n audience, in the Coliseum\n starts clapping\n and shouting “Encore & Wow.”\n Everybody whoever\n thot you were\n dumb & untalented\n goes apeshit\n over your hidden genius.\n “Gee, I never knew you\n played,” says your astonished high school\n principal.\n Notes:\nThis poem was previously published in _Hey Fella Would You Mind Holding This Piano a Moment_ (Ithaca House, 1974)and is reprinted here by permission of William J. Harris. It is part of the portfolio “I Hope You Like Being Here with Me: The Work of William J. Harris,” curated byHoward Rambsy II."
