  "poem": "We were made to understand it would be\n Terrible. Every small want, every niggling urge,\n Every hate swollen to a kind of epic wind.\n Livid, the land, and ravaged, like a rageful\n Dream. The worst in us having taken over\n And broken the rest utterly down.\nA long age\n Passed. When at last we knew how little\n Would survive us—how little we had mended\n Or built that was not now lost—something\n Large and old awoke. And then our singing\n Brought on a different manner of weather.\n Then animals long believed gone crept down\n From trees. We took new stock of one another.\n We wept to be reminded of such color."
